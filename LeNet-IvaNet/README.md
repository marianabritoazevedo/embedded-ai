## Hyperparameter Tuning with sweep

## Model 1: LeNet-5

This architecture of this Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was described by Yann LeCun, et al. in their 1998 paper titled [Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/726791) and it was one of the first successful applications of CNNs.

In this first part of the project, the goal was make the hyperparameter tuning using the sweep from [Wandb](https://wandb.ai) and see which is the best configuration for LeNet-5
