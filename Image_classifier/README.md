## :camera: Image classifier: dog, cat or panda
This project aims to create different models of Machine Learning (ML) to solve the following problem: given an image, classify it as an image that contains a dog, a cat or a panda. For this project, three ML models will be used for the image classification:
- __K-nearest neighbors__ (KNN) algorithm, from the library scikit-learn;
- __Multi-layer perceptron classifier__ (MLPClassifier), from the library scikit-learn;
- __Convolucional neural network__ (CNN), from the library TensorFlow.

## :bulb: Project flow
For this project, it was also used the tool named Weights & Biases (also known as Wandb) to make the model management. Based on its operation, the big-picture of the data pipeline used in this project can be seen in the figure below.
