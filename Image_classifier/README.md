## :camera: Image classifier: dog, cat or panda
This project aims to create different models of Machine Learning (ML) to solve the following problem: given an image, classify it as an image that represents a dog, a cat or a panda. For this project, three ML models will be used for the image classification:
- __K-nearest neighbors__ (KNN) algorithm, from the library scikit-learn;
- __Multi-layer perceptron classifier__ (MLPClassifier), from the library scikit-learn;
- __Convolucional neural network__ (CNN), from the library TensorFlow.
